## Properties

Particle entities have the properties common to all entities as well as additional particle specific properties.

When you create or select a Particle entity, you can edit these properties from the Particle menu.

>>>>> The **Color** property appears in both, the **Properties** tab and the **Particle Explorer** tab. This is the same property. But, when you change the value in one tab, the value isnâ€™t updated in the other. it is reflected in both places only once you select another entity and then re-select the particle entity.

Below is an image of a particle entity with a different color.
